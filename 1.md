Задача. 

Identify and analyze a device which is an IoT device now, but was a non-IoT device in the past. Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now. Enumerate any improvements, or any diminishments if they exist. Are there any limitations that are present in the new IoT version of the device? Are there privacy issues that never existed in the original version of the device?
